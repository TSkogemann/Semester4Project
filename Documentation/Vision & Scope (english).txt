Project 4. Semester (Thomas, Jonathan & Rasmus)


VOLLEYBALL INFO APP:


1.1 BACKGROUND

Our vision is to make an app that combines information from, to and inbetween Volleyball arrangements, both from the participants, spectators & organisators side.

Furthermore we want to make it easy to view you upcoming events in a functional and smart design.


Today the way Volleyball and many other sports organize they organize their matches and tournaments, are very outdated and bony.


Keywords: 
Needed, simplicity, stability, viewability & design


1.2 BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY


We think our App will help the people who currently uses spreadsheet and papir to organize, to become much more effecient and give a far better overview, which will directly lead to far less crucial mistakes.


There is no currently working system that allows every team and coordinator of the Volleyball association to communicate and establish tournaments. Therefore it should be relatively easy and straight-forward to implement our app, if we will succeed to create a proper working system that has the sufficient functionality.


1.3 BUSINESS OBJECTIVES AND SUCCESS CRITERIA

1. Usage-objective:

If our app is used daily by a big percentage of the entirety of the volleyball association, our goal has been achieved

2. (Sustain & maintain)-objective:

Is our stabile? is it fast? Is it effective? and overall does it work as intended-
If we can say yes to all this - this objective is partly a story of success. (partly-success as of, stability will allways be at risk, by alot of different factors, so this is an ongoing process)

3. (Money & Value)-objective

We will feel that our app is succesfull, when it generates a certain amount of money annually, from our Shop inside the App.
